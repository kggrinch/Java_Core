# Java Practice Core

## Overview
A personal practice repository focusing on the core features of Java and my journey learning the language. This collection contains a variety of projects I created while exploring the fundamentals of Java. Projects range from simple console input/output exercises to class inheritance, interfaces, and object-oriented design principles. Each folder focuses on a specific concept I practiced, allowing me to develop a solid understandings of what makes Java a versatile and widely used programming language.

## Concepts Covered
* PackagesInJava/Tools – Organizing classes into packages and using package structure for modularization.
* Serialization – Saving and restoring objects using Java serialization.
* Threads – Basics of multithreading, creating and running concurrent tasks.
* package1 – Example package demonstrating basic Java package.
* package2 – Additional package examples to practice modularization and imports.
* Abstraction.java – Using abstract classes and methods to define common behavior while leaving implementation to subclasses.
* AccessModifiers.java – Understanding public, private, protected, and default access levels.
* Aggregation.java – Demonstrating has-a relationships and object composition.
* AnonymousInnerClasses.java – Creating and using anonymous inner classes for clean implementations.
* AnonymousObjects.java – Using objects without references to simplify code.
* Encapsulation.java – Protecting data with private fields and public getter/setter methods.
* Enum.java – Defining enumerated types for fixed sets of constants.
* Generics.java – Implementing type-safey and reusable classes and methods using generics.
* Inheritance.java – Extending classes and reusing functionality through parent-child relationships.
* InnerClasses.java – Using nested and inner classes to group code.
* Interface.java – Defining interfaces and implementing them in classes.
* JavaCompileAndRunWithCommandPrompt.java – Compiling and executing Java programs from the command line.
* Keywords.java – Reviewing reserved words and their purpose in the language.
* Lambda.java – Writing concise functions using Java lambda expressions.
* Main.java – Default driver file
* MethodChaining.java – Calling multiple methods sequentially on the same object.
* Polymorphism.java – Demonstrating dynamic method dispatch and method overriding.
* PrintF.java – Formatting output using System.out.printf for readable console display.
* ProgrammingOperations.java – Performing arithmetic, logical, and relational operations.
* ProgramsIntoApplications.java – Converting simple programs into fully structured Java applications.
* Recursion.java – Writing recursive methods for problem solving and algorithm practice.
* SwitchCases.java – Multi-way branching using switch-case statements.
* TimeAndSpaceComplexity.java – Evaluating algorithm efficiency and memory usage.
* VariableScope.java – Understanding local, instance, and class-level variable lifetimes and accessibility.

## Purpose
This repository is designed as a personal learning sandbox rather than a developed library of concepts. The projects within this repository reflect my progress in the Java programming language and provide a space for me to experiment, make mistakes, and improve in my programming. I plan to further expand my collection and learn new techniques,
patterns and algorithms while learning Java.
